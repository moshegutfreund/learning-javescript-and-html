		  style="color:black;"> &emsp;<b><span style="color:blue">Artificial Intelligence</span></b> is different from machine learning in the sense that AI is developing a progam that can make a computer perform tasks that would usually require a person with human intelligence to complete. On the other hand <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">machine learning</span> is when a computer is told to analyze patterns in a data to apply and then perform tasks, having “learnt” the rules of the topic, such as using the number of legs, to identify between a picture of a human vs a horse.  Artifical intelligence is a term used for all kinds of intelligent machines, making its relation to machine learning an umbrella term. Machine learning is then a specific subset of AI where the machine learns from data but is not <i>explicitly</i> programmed.

		<p style="color:black;">
			&emsp; A machine learns from its experiences, such as learning to recognice voice, recognice text, and images. By making a computer program that is capable of analyzing the differences and similarities between images, it then learns the rules to determine what category a new data point will fall into. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Machine learning</span> is very good at a specific task but will not transfer over to the next topic. It’s all about pattern recognition and then acting based on it.

		<p style="color:black;">  &emsp; <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Artificial Intelligence</span> is a much more generalistic term for machines with some degree of intelligence. They learn rules, abstract thinking, and “intuition”. It makes them think they’re smart but really they are just given an unimaginable amount of data first. The example given is usually a man in a room with an infinite number of books, encyclopedias or dictionaries. When you ask the man a question and he knows the answer, he's not <i>actually</i> smart, he was just given all the information.
