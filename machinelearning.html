				<td> AlphaGo, by Google
				</td>
				<td> 2016 </td>
				<td>Google became the first computer that can beat an unhaddicapped professional human player in the game. It used a combination of learning and tree search techniques, which was adapted to Chess in 2017. </td>

					<td> Infervision
					</td>
					<td> 2021 </td>
					<td> Infervision an AI tool used for medical imaging solutions. It was originally designed to be able to read CT scans and detect lung cancer but has since been adapted to detect Covid infections. By automating this process healthcare professionals can expand access to care and improve it for everyone.</td>
